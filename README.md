# SC1015-Project
This project aims to analyze Kickstarter data to predict the success of a kickstarter project. 
Kickstarter serves as a platform for innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs to bring their project ideas to life. However, there are always uncertainty and risks that comes with backing a project, as some projects has higher potential for success while some are more likely to fail. Using ML to analyze historical data on kickstarter projects, we can develop a predictive model that can forecast the success of a kickstarter project, so that investors or supporters can have better decision making when it comes to choosing which project to support.
